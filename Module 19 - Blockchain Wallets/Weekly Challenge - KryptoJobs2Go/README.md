### A look inside crypto_wallet

We started off my creating three functions that govern the Ethereum transactions. 
- `generate_account` function creates a wallet based on a given mnemonic. We then derive the private and public keys for the wallet. Once the keys are generated, we create an ethereum account. 
- `get_balance` function gets the balance of a given account and converts from the lowest denomination (wei) to the largest denomination (ether). 
- `send_transaction` function essentials collects all the parameters of a transaction (receiver, sender, amount, gas estimate, gas prices, nonce), signs the transaction based on the initiating account and sends the transaction to the receiever.
