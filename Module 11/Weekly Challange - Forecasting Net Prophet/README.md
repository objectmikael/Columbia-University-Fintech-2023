### Section 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

![Close Price and Search Trends Time Series](Images/compare_time_series_2020.png)
- Both time series indicate a common trend consistent with the narrative. A market event occured on 2020-02-25 where the stock price and search traffic had a sharp decline. The initial shock lasted until about 2020-03-11 when activity picked back up in stock price and search traffic. It took about a month for Mercado to find its footing but around 2020-04-01 both the stock price and search traffic began to steadily tick upwards.

<br><br>

![Correlations](Images/correlation.png)
- There is a weak negative correlation between Lagged Search Trends and Stock Volatility. This suggests that there may be a slight tendency for higher search trends to be associated with lower stock volatility. But because the relation is weak, the relationship may not be strong or reliable. There is a very weak correlation between Lagged Search Trends and Hourly Stock Return, which suggest no relationship.
