    * Who are you? What is your background?
		- My name is Mikael and I'm a project management professional with 10+ years of experience and a passion for helping others to realize thier potential and be successful in whatever they do. I hold a BS in Mechanical Engineering but have spent the last six years in the EdTech and Online Betting space serving as a project manager. I work closely with product and engineering teams to deliver new products and features to the end user.
    * What are your career goals?
		- As of the end of 2023, I'd like to pivot into the financial services industry. I'm currently exploring the various roles within the space but I'm leaning towards a developer role within Blockchain/Payments or data analyst in Capital Markets.
    * Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
		- FinTech is changing the way society thinks about and handles money and I'd like to better understand the various technologies that governs this new wave. I also believe the sector has a higher earning ceiling which can afford me more opportunities.
