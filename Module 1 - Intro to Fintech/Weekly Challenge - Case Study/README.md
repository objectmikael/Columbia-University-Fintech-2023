* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
	- Because Zip Co is an Australian based company, I had a difficult time confirming the technologies used. Using Crunchbase, I was able to identify <code>HTML5</code> <code>jQuery</code> and <code>Google Analytics</code>. However, a closer look at Zip's competitor's tech stacks, I was able to identity various components needed:    
		- Core programming language(s) for website and mobile app.
		- A platform to manage payments. 
		- A platform/service to verify user and determine user spending power. 
		- Any additional platforms for day-to-day operations.

	- **Zip's Current Products**<sup>(8)</sup>
		- Zip Pay: a digital wallet and credit account that allows users to make purchases with participating merchants and pay for them later in interest-free installments.
		- Zip Money: a higher credit limit product designed for larger purchases and longer-term payment options. It provides consumers with a line of credit for amounts typically above what is available through Zip Pay. Zip Money offers interest-free periods for up to 36 months.
	- **Prospects**
		- Debit Card: Growth in the BNPL space is directly related with increased customer engagement. Debit cards are excepted by almost all merhcnats worldwide, so keeping a customer in Zip's ecosystem, will allow them to capitalize on the BNPL side of the business. A goal for most BNPL providers is to have their product be ```top of wallet``` for consumers which means its their first or most accessible choice for payment. 
			
		- Financial Wellness Dashboard: Consumers today are increasingly becoming more invested in their financial wellbeing, given the hike in interest rates. An integrated dashboard in Zip's app may increase time-on-app which should have a direct correlation to increase transactions per user.

	- Offering the two products above will allow consumers to ```Stay Within the Zip Co Ecosystem``` longer, which can enhance user enaggement and position the company as a comprehensive financial planner.
