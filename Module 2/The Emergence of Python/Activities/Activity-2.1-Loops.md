# Loop De Loop

In this activity, you will explore a number of use cases for using loops to gain more experience with iterating through string sequences and ranges of numbers.

## Background

You've been contacted by your company's HR department to help build employee morale and excitement about FinTech. The HR department wants you to create a small Python cheerleading program that can be embedded on the homepage of the company's intranet site. The program should loop through a string and print out a cheer using each letter in the string.

## Instructions

1. Create a variable named `cheer` that holds a single word as a string.
    ```python
    Solution:
    cheer = 'WOOHOO!!!'
    ```

2. Use a `for` loop to loop through each letter in the word.
    ```python
    Solution:
    for letter in cheer:
        print(letter)
    ```

3. Print out a cheer message.
    ```python
    Solution:
    print(f'We won. {cheer}') 
    ```
